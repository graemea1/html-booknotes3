       <p>I read Maria Giudice's book  “Changemakers: How Leaders Can Design Change in an Insanely Complex World.” New York: Rosenfeld Media, 2023. Apple Books. ] at the start of 2023. </p>
        <p>I read it on Apple Books. Why? I like the ability to highlight and transfer those highlights straight into Apple Notes. The snag? You really need to review them to make the most of your newfound knowledge. So I’ve decided to do a quick recap of those notes here.

            <h2>Wicked vs VUCA</h2>
                <p>What we used to call 'Wicked Problems' could now be characterised as VUCA. That is: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Volatile</li>
                        <li>Uncertain</li>
                        <li>Complex</li>
                        <li>Ambiguous</li>


                    </ul>
    
            <h2>Organised vs haphazard change</h2>
                <p>Change should not be haphazard. It needs to be applied in an organised way. Furthermore, people who will be responsible for bringing that change about need to feel engaged and empowered to bring change about. 
                </p>
            <h2>Change is not a zero-sum game </h2>
                <p>That is, we cannot look at change as being all or nothing. It is impossible to change into some “godlike manifestation” of the change you want to see any more than it is acceptable to simply resign and atrophy under current conditions. To reiterate the earlier point about haphazard vs organised change, change that leans into chaos is also not desirable. 
                </p>   
             <h2>Who will be changemakers? </h2>
                <p>Change will be brought about by viewing problems, perhaps even VUCA ones, as design problems. Who best to do that? Designers. Changemakers should be able to look bring a process of problem definition, intentional study and reliable interventions. It’s difficult to say that problems can be ‘fixed’ as problems fit into systems. As one part of a system is altered, so something else is affected. One day’s fix is another tomorrow’s problem, essentially. 
                </p>
            <h2>Definition of making change</h2>
                <p>It means to “Drive a systemic transformation of something from its current state to a more preferred one by adopting the mindset, the frameworks and the techniques common to design”. (Page place omitted for this quote)
                </p>
            <h2>Who can be a changemaker? </h2>
                <p>Anyone can do it. Changemakers need to act with courage, but also with intent. They need to work toward systemic change regardless of their actual position within an organisation — perhaps even a system. Changemakers should also “inspire and unite” people toward a shared purpose and vision. Purpose is incredibly important here. And, to quote the authors again, “The test of courage is not a solo act, nor is it as simple as facing tough odds. Courage is an everyday act.” In short, be courageous, always. 
                </p>
            <h2>On courage</h2>
                <p>Remember that courage is “the ability to move forward despite the fear you feel”, taking on various opinions and challenges along the way with an undauntedly open mind. Think of fear as a partner to help guide you through rather than “a cliff you jump off”. 
                </p>
            <h2>A word of warning</h2>
                <p>Do not underestimate how important it is to understand your organisation's openness to change. Also, be sure to find yourself a sponsor or champion who can help you make your changes, to set them with realistic and measurable expectations and resources. 
                </p>
                <p>Change will also be difficult if you make people feel threatened or anxious or confused. Seek common ground always. Changemaking is not about bringing about finite nuggets of change.
                    It's also about creating the conditions for doing things differently in perpetuity.  </p>
            <h2>How to bring about that change </h2>
                <p>Communicate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why change is needed — this could be a hypothesis or a conclusion</li>
                        <li>What needs to change</li>
                        <li>Benefits that will result</li>
                        <li>Costs to be incurred or saved </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>None of this needs to be highly detailed. Be sure to underline a sense of how you'll know you're being successful with specific, achievable and measurable criteria. </p>
            <h2>For the team</h2>
                    <p>Consider a “Charter” or perhaps even a playbook — a sketch thereof —  that will set out goals and intent anticipation of struggles and how to collaborate. This could also include shared values and principles, risks and scope. 

                        Really, the team should set out some ground rules about working together. 
                        
                        What’s also helpful is to set out some sort of timeline for action. </p>
            <h2>The leader </h2>
                 <p>This person needs to act even when consensus is not possible. The leader will need to understand members of the team, strengths and weaknesses, motivations and so on. Plus the person needs to encourage honesty, including being transparent about their own misgivings and weaknesses. They need to be comfortable in vulnerability and seek help when required. 
                </p>  
            <h2>The narrative in communication</h2>
                <p>There needs to be a communication strategy. One that embraces narrative structure is best. Be clear about answering the ‘Why’ of what you’re doing. Always bear in mind: 
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The audience</li>
                        <li>The purpose</li>
                        <li>The medium </li>
                        <li>The timing</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>These things are everything and can make a big difference. Also ask yourself what your communication is for: </p>
                    <ul>
                        
                        <li>To inform? </li>
                        <li>To persuade? </li>
                        <li>To engage? </li>
                        <li>To inspire? </li>
                    </ul> 
                <p>When doing research, put findings and resulting actions into a form that fits that overall narrative. If it does not fit, consider leaving it out. 
                </p>
                <p>Use the <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/">double diamond </a> and other design thinking methods</p>
                <img src="Double_Diamond.png" alt="Diagram of the Design Council's double diamond framework">
            <h2>Do your research </h2>
                <p>Find out why a situation is as it is. Explore what's already happening. Think about what you learn and have an idea of action or actions to be taken in light of that discovery.
                </p>
                <h3>Think about: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People impacted by the recommended change</li>
                        <li>Intended or possible unintended consequences, like needs for new technologies or management tiers </li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>Consider using journey maps to illustrate pain points, opportunities and other consequences

                    Finally, remember that solutions, or interventions, are not always clearcut and singular. There’s often a range of possibilities. Show what’s possible, always. 
                    </p>  
            <h2>Envisioned outcomes </h2>
                    <p>I’m not a great lover of the term ‘envision’. But, to frame your outcomes, check that you directly address the change brief or mission. And make sure that the state outcome:  </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Directly addresses change brief or mission</li>
                            <li>Considers issues uncovered by research including that with internal stakeholders</li>
                            <li>Offers guidance </li>
                            <li> Bears in mind consequences for colleagues and other people</li>
                             <li>Is feasible and realistic </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Do not be afraid to say that you don’t know something. That is, flag unknown unknowns and be prepared to speculate.

            <h2>Changemakers are human </h2>
                    <p> Possible pitfalls for changemakers look like: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Micromanagement </li>
                            <li> Preachiness</li>
                            <li> Overpromising and an inability to say no </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Use the group and ground rules to hold you in check. Also, be vulnerable and honest. </p>
            <h2>Remember this about the future</h2>
                    <p>It’s not ‘about time’, it’s timeless, so to speak. What counts is the small increments of change that are gradually unfolding, inch by inch. 
                    </p>
