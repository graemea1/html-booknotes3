    <h1>From Erika Hall's "Just Enough Research"</h1>
        <cite>Hall, Erika -- Just Enough Research, second edition. A Book Apart</cite>
        <p>I read this book back in late 2021-early 2022. This is a monster of a book, not in terms of size or complexity, but rather, in terms of its impact. Erika Hall's message is simple: if you’re making design decisions, you need to ask questions. Doing so need not be complicated, but knowing how to do it right is as important as the asking itself. </p>
        <p>I read this on Apple Books and made a series of highlights. I always intended to review what I'd saved. I'm using this website content creation project as an opportunity to do so. </p>

            <h2>Notes on Just Enough Research, second edition by Erika Hall (A Book Apart,
                2019) </h2>
               <h3>Erika's top tips for handling research</h3> 
               <b>Don't let it drift and don't be distracted by what doesn't matter. Do this: </b>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Focus on essential user types</li>
                        <li>Deal with data as soon as it's in</li>
                        <li>Analyse data as a team</li>
                        <li>Do the less important stuff later </li>
                    </ul> 
                <h3>There are 6 steps for running a research project</h3>
                <b>These are as follows: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Define the problem </li>
                        <li> Select the approach</li>
                        <li>Plan and prepare for the research</li>
                        <li> Collect the data</li>
                        <li>Analyse the data </li>
                        <li>Share the results </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Research needs a clear purpose</h3>
                <b> However you organise your research team, everyone on it needs to understand:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why the research is being carried out</li>
                        <li>How it will be conducted</li>
                        <li>Their role in the process </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3> Research can be generative or descriptive </h3>
                <b>Generative can include: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interviews</li>
                        <li>Field observation </li>
                        <li>Literature review </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Consider descriptive research as what you do when you have a sense of the design problem and need to know more about what you're working on. So, it's observing and describing characteristics of what you're studying. As Hall puts it, it's the “homework” you need to do to fully understand the context and that you're designing for an audience rather than yourself. 
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Planning research </h3>
                <b>The research plan should include: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Problem statement </li>
                        <li>Research questions </li>
                        <li>Interview guide or test script  </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>It works really well as a team activity to help provide a common purpose.</p>

                <hr />
                <h3>Analysing research </h3>
                <p> While a team can include a specialised analyst role, it's useful for this to be a group activity to help avoid bias. </p>
 
            <blockquote>“Organisations that don't put in the effort to clarify goals, socialise understanding and resolve conflicts will continue to make critical decisions based on the personal preferences of the most influential person in the room…” </blockquote> 

        <hr />
                <h3>How can we promote the idea of research internally? </h3>
                <p>Say that your intent is to produce better products and get buy-in to that idea. Then get into how to get there. For the team, set out: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Clear goals </li>
                        <li> Reasonable timelines </li>
                        <li> Known knowns and unknowns unknowns </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> Consider RITE</h3>
                        <p> That is, Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation </p>
                    <h3>Who are the user types to be prioritised?  </h3>
                        <p>They are the ones who are the least like your devs, and whose acceptance of the product is critical. Do usability testing or interviews to understand their behaviour. 
                        </p>
        <hr />
                    <h3> Research questions</h3>
                        <b>A good research question:  </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is based on outcome-based verb such as evaluate, describe, identify </li>
                                <li> Avoids non-specific words like explore or understand </li>
                                <li> Is specific, actionable and practical </li>
                            </ul>
                        <p> They might be a single question, subquestions or something in between. Make sure they all add up to a coherent problem statement. 
                        </p>
                        <p> So, your document should include your summary of what it's setting out to do. E.g. We will describe how users navigate the site and where they encounter barriers … or similar 
                        </p>

                    <h3>And, what is the data?  </h3>
                        <b> The data is the participant's:</b>
                            <ul> 
                                <li>Goals  </li>
                                <li> Priorities</li>
                                <li> Tasks </li>
                                <li>Motivators  </li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>For further detail:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Goals entail what they want to do and how the product or service will get them there </li>
                                <li>Priorities are what’s important to them </li>
                                <li> Tasks include steps they take to get them to their goal </li>
                                <li> Motivators are the context or reasons that they’ll need to accomplish those goals </li>    
                            </ul>
                        <p> Obviously, the goals are incredibly important to them, but bearing in mind all those other factors to help get a fuller picture.</p>


                        <b>Data is also: </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Barriers  </li>
                                <li> Habits</li>
                                <li>Tools  </li>
                                <li> Environment </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Internal considerations </h3>
                            <p> Make sure everyone who will be affected is consulted, to be sure to get their perspective and to discover a wide range of possible consequences, intended or unintended. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Look to technical constraints.  </p>
                            <p> Also, invite people to participate in the research, rather than simply asking them questions. </p>
                        <h3>On mental model  </h3>
                            <p> How your user believes a thing will work where working entails its organisation and functionality.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <h3>When it comes to quantitative methods </h3>
                            <ul> 
                                <li> You want to achieve a 95% confidence level </li>
                                <li> You want to minimise possible variables that might be having an effect on your data</li>
                            </ul>
